# Product Recommendation System for e-commerce businesses

Recommendation systems will help businesses improve their customer's experience and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

The recommendation system, we are creating in this project has three sections:

#### 1. A recommender for a new customer who lands on the businessâ€™s website for the first time, this recommendor is a product popularity based system called **content-based-filtering** 

#### 2. A recommender for a returning customer based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought similar items called **collaborative-filtering** 

#### 3. A recommender for a business website when setting up its e-commerce for the first time without any product rating using a **hybrid recommender system** which is a combination of previous recommenders

When a new customer without any previous purchase history visits the e-commerce website for the first time, they are recommended the most popular products sold on the company's website using a content based filtering system. Once, they make a purchase, the recommendation system updates and recommends other products based on the purchase history and ratings provided by other users on the website using collaborative filtering techniques.
